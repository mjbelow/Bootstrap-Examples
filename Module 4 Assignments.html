<p><span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif; font-size: 14pt;">This assignment consists of one quiz and one lab. The lab will have two parts (A and B) -- please name your files lab4a.html and lab4b.html and host them on ps11 somewhere in your public_html folder (you may use subdirectories). Please email me the links to your files after you are done.<br /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif; font-size: 14pt;">The plan is to complete the <strong>quiz by Tuesday (10/01)</strong>, during class. <strong>The lab will be due by Sunday (10/06), by the end of the day.</strong><br /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif; font-size: 14pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif; font-size: 14pt;">1)&nbsp; Complete the <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bootstrap Tutorial</a>. I do not recommend waiting until the quiz deadline day to start the tutorial.<br /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif; font-size: 14pt;">2)&nbsp; </span><span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif; font-size: 14pt;">Take the <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_quiz.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bootstrap Quiz</a>. You may practice the quiz before the deadline if you'd like, just let me know when it is completed. Multiple attempts are allowed (as long as class time allows). <br /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif; font-size: 14pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif; font-size: 14pt;">3)&nbsp; </span><span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif; font-size: 14pt;">Lab Assignment 4:<br /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif; font-size: 14pt;">Both parts A and B require some initial design time and effort. I would advise taking the time to think about (and perhaps sketch) what you want these pages to look like and make some notes. Plans are not something you need to turn in, but it could make the lab *much* easier than simply jumping straight to coding.<br /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif; font-size: 14pt;">Part A:<br /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif; font-size: 14pt;">Select one of the Bootstrap templates from the "<a href="http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Getting Started with Bootstrap</a>" tutorial examples and create an opening page for a traveling symphony orchestra. This exercise is to familiarize you with Bootstrap and let you practice a little bit with your design skills on a "random" project. You only have to create one page and should use any relevant photos you would like (cite sources/give credit), but you must create the text and the layout. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif; font-size: 14pt;">For full credit, this part of the lab must:<br /></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif; font-size: 14pt;">Use Bootstrap extensively. Using CSS/Less/HTML is allowed, but the main focus of this lab is Bootstrap and any lab that does not use it will not receive credit (even if the page has all the necessary content and style).<br /></span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif; font-size: 14pt;">Include several images. Please be sure to cite sources.<br /></span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif; font-size: 14pt;">Include a tour schedule. This should be a neatly organized table. The table should be responsive (grading will include window resizing, and credit for this part of the lab will depend partly on how your table responds).<br /></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif; font-size: 14pt;">Part B:<br /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif; font-size: 14pt;">This is a continuation of the car dealership survey assignment. Use Bootstrap to create a simple main page for the dealership. <span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif; font-size: 14pt;">Use Bootstrap extensively.</span> The page should include the following elements:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif; font-size: 14pt;">Must be consistent with overall theme (colors, appropriate alignment, etc.)<br /></span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif; font-size: 14pt;">Include at least three images of vehicles available at the dealership.<br /></span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif; font-size: 14pt;">Include information about each vehicle, including pricing, vehicle technical details, and any other information that might be useful to the site's user.<br /></span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif; font-size: 14pt;">A "Contact Online Sales" section -- make up contact info, don't use anything real.<br /></span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif; font-size: 14pt;">A "Take Online Survey" section -- this should link up with/utilize your Lab 3 work (or Lab 2b, if you prefer).<br /></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif; font-size: 14pt;">Note that there are quite a few different ways to implement this page. What Bootstrap elements you choose to use is up to you, however, please try to make your page look polished and professional (and also consistent with your other pages -- survey and contact online sales).</span></p>
